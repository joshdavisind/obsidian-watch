summary: Discussion on creating a baseline for different partner types, focusing on core services like colocation, cloud services, and disaster recovery as a service. Emphasis on telling a cohesive story rather than just presenting products.
project: unclassified

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Alright. Okay. So the idea for this is to get all of our thoughts out, to create a baseline for different partners and create some of the nuances around what we're doing. I envision this being a different PowerPoint and model for different types of partners. So we should have a different one for VARs, we should have a different one for the OEMs and alignment partners that we work with—Pure Storage, VMware, Nutanix. Those are probably the key three.

The idea behind this is to tell a better story here, as opposed to leveraging just the traditional slide deck of "here's a product." We're trying to make this more cohesive. Looking at the pillar slide—we've got six different pillars. I don't think the pillars should all be the same size. Some should be smaller and on the outside. For example, I envision cloud-native and AI control as ancillary services—not core.

We are not a product-based company; we are solutions-based. I think our three core pillars are: colocation, cloud services—which includes enterprise cloud (VMware), dedicated cloud (VMware or Nutanix)—and disaster recovery as a service. Would you agree?

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Yeah. I don't think there's much value in showing "here's our journey of services." That just signals cloud-native and AI are brand new and not mature. We should focus on the bread and butter.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Do you ever sell any opportunities where it's just cloud-native or just AI?

**Jacob Figueroa:**
They're bolt-ons. Those kinds of deals should only happen if there's drag for our core services.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Exactly. And they often introduce more people into the buying cycle, increasing complexity. Colo, IaaS, and DRaaS are the core. Different skill sets are involved when we talk about AI or cloud-native—those audiences are different.

We often hear, "I didn't know this was possible," from customers who made recent capital purchases. That lets us build a roadmap—maybe to VMware or Nutanix cloud over 36 to 60 months.

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Depends who you're talking to. A VP versus a CIO will interpret things differently. A lot of them just default to AWS, Azure, or GCP, or they think, "Maybe I'll just do one more refresh." They don't know there's another option.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Exactly. For VARs, selling hardware is table stakes. It's a race to register Pure, Dell, NetApp. What we offer helps them become more strategic, with stickier revenue and longer-term value.

Expedient allows customers to use existing assets. We build out of our own facilities, so they can colocate gear until it's fully depreciated. For example, bring your own SAN with Pure. We provide front-end switching, VMware or Microsoft licensing, or let them bring their own. These customers are sticky, and it builds pipeline visibility.

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Yeah, it's about turning VARs from product pushers into strategic partners. Right now, there's not a lot of loyalty—just price-shopping every few years. This changes that.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Regarding Nutanix—it's not just about AHV vs. VMware. Nutanix is software. We can host primary or DR infrastructure on Nutanix. Even if they start on VMware, we're the largest Nutanix cloud in the world—more nodes than hyperscalers.

The recent Nutanix-Pure announcement and our support for AHV bridges the ecosystem.

**Jacob Figueroa:**
In the Southwest, Nutanix reps bring us in for DRaaS because they don't want to muddy their production deals. But no one has a good story for customers with VMware renewals under Broadcom. They basically say, "Just renew and we'll figure it out."

**Jeff Fertitta:**
We can help with that. Broadcom killed VVF. Now it's only VCF, and only 3–5-year terms. That's tough. We can provide bridge licensing to cover customers until they're ready to migrate. It's all about giving them options and risk mitigation.

Also, we support customers who want to CapEx their OpEx, because we can provide serial numbers for dedicated hosts. That's another flexibility point.

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Yeah, you're covering it all. That's basically our whole playbook.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
What about DRaaS—should it be its own pillar or fall under IaaS?

**Jacob Figueroa:**
It should go under the cloud pillar. Some competitors offer ultra-cheap, oversubscribed DRaaS. We don't. Our DR is built on the same production platform. If you want DR that works, you go with us.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
And telling a roadmap story is key. Even if DR is the entry point, it grows from there. We've seen it evolve into full production moves. That's what happened with Brinks—they regret buying Nutanix nodes before meeting us. But now we've got their DR, and we're positioned for production later.

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Yeah, things like AI bolt-ons are tertiary. DRaaS proves the platform.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Also, when we license VMware, we can thin-provision DR workloads. That's a big cost difference compared to customers having to fully license both primary and DR under VCF.

We've had customers start with 200 cores and plan to shrink. With us, they can reassign licenses from primary to DR. It extends the value of their Broadcom purchase and gives them a path forward—eventually shifting licensing to Expedient if needed.

**Jacob Figueroa:**
I've had some of those Broadcom discussions. We need to get better at explaining bridge licensing—not just as a cheaper alternative, but a way to gain flexibility even if they stay on VMware.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Everyone loves VMware. They hate Broadcom. That's our wedge. We separate the product from the vendor and offer flexibility.

Bridge licensing is risk management. It keeps the customer safe while they plan a migration. They don't need to lock into another 3-year deal—they can start small, preserve capital, and retain options.

Do you think the pillar slide is the best format? Or is a Visio diagram more effective for storytelling?

**Jacob Figueroa:**
I think the pillar format is fine, but we need to tell a better story. The honeycomb slide is overwhelming—too much at once. We should guide people step by step.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Agreed. We need to simplify the story: we help customers simplify their environment and give them a roadmap. For most partners, we need to shorten the learning curve—whether they're new or experienced. Most sellers are somewhere in the middle.

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Yeah.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Anything else we need to hit?

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Maybe just entry points. But not all of them make sense for us—it's not worth detailing here.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Our main entry points are:
- How do you feel about Broadcom?
- What's your VMware lifecycle?
- Are you running your own data center?
- What's your cloud strategy?
- Have you had a DR event recently?
- Are you holding infrastructure longer than expected?
- What's your staffing model? Who's managing this?

**Jacob Figueroa:**
Also: customers already invested in Pure or Nutanix who want to shift to "as-a-service" but don't want to abandon those investments.

**Jeff Fertitta:**
Exactly. The "middle ground cloud" is what most people want. We're not competing with AWS or Azure—they have their place. We're talking about the legacy workloads that aren't cloud-native.

These customers want out of the data center business. They want out of the CapEx cycle. They're overwhelmed with backup, DR, hardware refreshes, and staffing. We simplify it. We become an extension of their IT department. That's the story.
